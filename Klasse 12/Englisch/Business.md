MARIA MÜLLER
Hello, am I speaking to Mr. Müller?

MICHAEL MAYER
Here is Michael Müller, am I speaking with Maria Müller from the Messe Essen GmbH?

MARIA MÜLLER
Speaking. Thank you for the call some days ago. I am quite sorry, that you couldn't reach me, because I was not available during lunch break. Which information do you need for the Schweisen&Schneiden fair?

MICHAEL MAYER
Thank you for your fast response. I have tryed to reach you for the prices of the trade fair stand for tree days as well the size of the trade fair stand.

MARIA MÜLLER
It will cost between 5000 and 8500 €. The price can depend on the size of your trade fair stand. We offer different trade fair stand sizes.

MICHAEL MAYER
Thank you. I need to discuss with my boss first because of the price. could you please send me a written quote?

MARIA MÜLLER
I will be happy to send you a quote. What is the company address?

MICHAEL MAYER
The company address is Alfredstraße 13 45133 Essen. Thank you for sending.

MARIA MÜLLER
I will send the offer out today.

MICHAEL MAYER
Thank you for your help. I am glad to receive the offer. I wish them another nice day.

MARIA MÜLLER

1. How would a handful of modified human affect the gene pool of entire future generations?
	- Could alternate the complete gene pool because their genes will be passed down to their children.
2. What would genetic engineering be used for at the beginning? How would that evolve?
	- Primary for health
	- Can evolve to give any change like looking's or intelligence
3. What could be a negative outcome of increased genetic engineering?
	- The temptation for huge upgrades will be great.
	- Rejecting not perfect humans
4. Which reality do we already face when it comes to selecting humans?
	- Preselecting humans on medical conditions

Hey Emily,

I'm thrilled to help and wanted to share some fascinating insights I came across in an article from the online magazine "sueddeutsche" regarding GMOs in the EU.
To begin with, the EU has adopted a favorable stance towards GMOs. Moreover, there's an ongoing discussion regarding a new bill that is currently in the spotlight. The proposed bill aims to establish green biotechnology as the new standard in the food supply chain.
One of the key features of this bill is the emphasis on targeted genetic modifications of plants. The EU is actively working towards agreements that involve the crossing of two new plants and the programming of new gene sequences. Intriguingly, changes brought about by New Genetic Technologies (NGTs) are no longer easily identifiable with conventional analysis methods.
Furthermore, the bill proposes that plants with up to 20 modifications should be treated on par with conventional plants. Additionally, NGT-plants or products can no longer face prohibitions or limitations. However, there are growing concerns among genetic technology experts that such a shift could potentially mark the end of organic products.
On a positive note, from a scientific standpoint, the bill is appreciated as it poses no known dangers to human health or nature. Supporters argue that GMOs, being resistant against bugs, also contribute to more efficient water and nutrient usage.
Interestingly, despite the scientific support, some political parties such as EVP, CDU, and CSU currently do not back the bill, making its fate uncertain. In light of this, an expert has recommended a comprehensive approach involving a package that includes pesticide reduction and the opening up of genetic engineering as a means of balancing interests.
I hope I could help you! Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions!

Kind regards,
MY NAME
